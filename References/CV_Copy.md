I am an energetic and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy.

After graduating from Cambridge University with a degree in Chemistry, I spent two years working in investment banking as a Commodities trader. Between leaving my job and now, I've spent a gap year travelling independently around South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand, raised over £40k for charity through sponsored cycles and learnt to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week software development bootcamp.

**Tech Skills** : Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

During my time at Bank of America, I wrote and distributed a daily newsletter to clients, with market commentary and data analysis. I have continued to develop my written communication skills by [blogging](http://codingwithlaura.wordpress.com) about my experience learning to code and I use it to develop a stronger online presence, by combining it with other social media outlets such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wilslau).
I have also taken up coaching at Codebar, a non-profit initiative which runs regular programming workshops.

#### Thrives under pressure

From having to organise an end-of-year ball during my final year at university, where the bulk of the organisation coincided with completing finals, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

#### Fast learner

I earned a full-time offer at Bank of America Merrill Lynch by impressing my line manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of finance and the technologies that the team used, despite having a scientific background and no previous experience in finance. For our [Makersbnb project](http://github.com/lsewilson/makers-bnb), I learnt Node.js and Express without it being taught on the course and used it to build a fully-functioning Airbnb-style website in a week.

#### Analytical thinker

In my role at Bank of America, I analysed new market data on a daily basis to generate trade ideas. Furthermore, I undertook a project to migrate all of our systems and trade history to a new legal entity. This required careful risk analysis which ensured there was no negative P&L impact on completion.
