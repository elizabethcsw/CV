An energetic and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a high-pressure role where I can extend my programming knowledge, while also gaining exposure to product management and business strategy. Ultimate goal is to become a technology entrepreneur and get involved in improving the healthcare system in China.

Between leaving my job and now, I have spent four months learning to code at Makers Academy, a 16-week highly intensive software development bootcamp in London.

I speak Mandarin, Cantonese and English fluently, and have extensive experiences working in multi-lingual environments.

**Tech Skills** : Swift, Javascript, Node.js, Express, jQuery, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Istanbul, Karma, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Rspec, Capybara, PostgreSQL, Realm, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Skills

#### Thrives under pressure

From having to organise 21 [events](#education) during my second year at university, and annual company ball during my time as [Management Trainee at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange](#experience), where the bulk of the organisation coincided with completing finals, meeting tight deadlines, organising large scale multi-party events including speakers handling, speeches and logistics, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

#### Fast learner

***During the bootcamp at Makers Academy:*** I have learnt and produced two mini React Native apps on my own, and an Node/Express Airbnb-clone with three other teammates in 5 days, without either of the technologies being taught on the course, while delivering every single weekend challenge during the bootcamp.

For our final project, Moomood ([github](https://github.com/jenniferbacon01/moomood), [deck](http://slides.com/elizabethchan/deck-1/fullscreen)), a team of 5 of us at Makers Academy learnt Swift 4 and Dialogflow, a natural processing framework, and used them to build a fully-functioning iOS mood chatbot in 10 days.

***Before I became a full stack developer:*** I earned a full-time offer at Hong Kong Stock Exchange by impressing my line manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of the listing framework in Hong Kong and its fund raising methodologies, and the technologies that the team used.

#### Team player
I believe in team work and XP values.  I make sure my teammates know that: "We can do it", "This is not too ambitious" and "You are better than you think you are".

I am confident that with perseverance and hard work, and good practices such as pair programming, daily retrospectives and transparent feedback, a team of developers can develop any product pictured in their mind.
