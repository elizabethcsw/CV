An energetic and ambitious **Full Stack Developer**, current working at [Healthera](https://healthera.co.uk/), a healthcare startup that facilitates prescriptions, medication reminders and communications between patients, pharmacies, surgeries and doctors in the UK. Core member of the development team.  Responsibilities include web development (frontend: React and AngularJS; backend: Node), continuous integration deployment (Jenkins and AWS) and project management. Ultimate goal is to become a technology entrepreneur and get involved in improving the healthcare system in China.

After graduating from Cambridge University with a BA and MA in Economics, I spent three years working in finance as a Management Trainee and then Associate at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. I eventually realised that I really wanted to build products that would improve people's experience in healthcare.  I resigned in June 2017 and joined Makers Academy in July 2017, a 16-week highly intensive software development bootcamp in London.  Straight after graduating from Makers Academy, I was recruited to Healthera, where I build amasing healthcare products with a team of six developers now.

Because of my previous experiences, I work well with the business team as well as the web and mobile development team.  I speak Mandarin, Cantonese and English fluently, and have extensive experiences working in multi-lingual environments.

**Tech Skills** : Javascript, React, AngularJS, Node.js, Express, jQuery, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Istanbul, Karma, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Rspec, Capybara, Swift, Cassandra, PostgreSQL, Realm, ElasticSearch, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Skills

#### Thrives under pressure

From having to organise 21 [events](#education) during my second year at university, and annual company ball during my time as [Management Trainee at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange](#experience), where the bulk of the organisation coincided with completing finals, meeting tight deadlines, organising large scale multi-party events including speakers handling, speeches and logistics, to completing group [projects](#projects), I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

#### Fast learner

***In Healthera:*** I emerged and became a core member of the development team albeit being the new joiner and new to development compared to other developers in the team.  I work on building and visualising the client side (React and Angular) as well as building endpoints in our server (Node in AWS) that linked with our no SQL database Cassandra and ElasticSearch.  I am responsible in building a new product from scratch in React, extending a natural language parser in lex and yacc, extending the api in Node and Express, and continuously deploying through our VPN gateway to our VPC on AWS.  I am also involved in product design and mockups.  I picked up all of that in the first three months thanks to a supportive team and I have not stopped improving upon what I already had from then.

For our final project, Moomood ([github](https://github.com/jenniferbacon01/moomood), [deck](http://slides.com/elizabethchan/deck-1/fullscreen)), a team of 5 of us at Makers Academy learnt Swift 4 and Dialogflow, a natural processing framework, and used them to build a fully-functioning iOS mood chatbot in 10 days.

***During the bootcamp at Makers Academy:*** I have learnt and produced two mini React Native apps on my own, and an Node/Express Airbnb-clone with three other teammates in 5 days, without either of the technologies being taught on the course, while delivering every single weekend challenge during the bootcamp.

For our final project, Moomood ([github](https://github.com/jenniferbacon01/moomood), [deck](http://slides.com/elizabethchan/deck-1/fullscreen)), a team of 5 of us at Makers Academy learnt Swift 4 and Dialogflow, a natural processing framework, and used them to build a fully-functioning iOS mood chatbot in 10 days.

***Before I became a full stack developer:*** I earned a full-time offer at Hong Kong Stock Exchange by impressing my line manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of the listing framework in Hong Kong and its fund raising methodologies, and the technologies that the team used.

#### Team player
I believe in team work and XP values.  I make sure my teammates know that: "We can do it", "This is not too ambitious" and "You are better than you think you are".

I am confident that with perseverance and hard work, and good practices such as pair programming, daily retrospectives and transparent feedback, a team of developers can develop any product pictured in their mind.
